Mini-Project 8: JSON
====================
05/01/2024

A simple JSON parser.

Implemented by Medhashree Adhikari, Alyssa Trapp, and Vivien Yen for CSC-207-01 2023Fa.

In this project, we will develop a JSON library for Java. JSON is “JavaScript Object Notation” and serves as a common format for passing information between programs. Basic JSONValues are included, Array, Constant, Hash, Integer, Real, String, Value, etc. And a basic parsing function is written, which take in a Reader file, and parsing which lines into a hashtable.
